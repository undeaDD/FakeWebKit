### Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  

You can copy, distribute, and modify this software under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but **WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY**; without even the implied warranty of  
**MERCHANTABILITY** or **FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE**. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program and want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to convey the exclusion of warranty:
